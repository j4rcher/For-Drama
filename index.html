        Punchdrunk was formed in 2000 by artistic director Felix Barrett. They focus on &ldquo;blending classic text, physical performance, award-winning design installations and unexpected sites&rdquo;. <br />
        Their style of theatre is heavily immersive (related to Promenade Theatre); the audience is free to choose whether to focus on individual performances and themes, or &ldquo;treat [the performance] as an art installation.&rdquo;<br />
        They practice &ldquo;location theatre&rdquo; often performing in outside, open spaces. Unlike Gecko and Paper Birds, they mix both classic plays and devised work. <br />
        Recently, they&rsquo;ve begun wearing Greek masks during performances as they found that &ldquo;suddenly inhibition fell away and people found a sense of freedom in their anonymity&rdquo;.<br />
        Their ultimate aim is to reject &ldquo;passive obedience&rdquo; to the production that is usually expected of audiences. This is where they get their name; they want the audiences to feel &ldquo;Punchdrunk&rdquo; after performances.<br />
        They are a registered charity, and often run workshops in schools and colleges.<br />
        It is one of their YouTube videos that is playing on the homepage.<br />

        Gecko Theatre was founded in 2001 by Israeli artistic director Amit Lahav. They are an &ldquo;award winning theatre company&rdquo; that promotes a &ldquo;visual, visceral, ambitious&rdquo; style. Lahav worked with such artists as Steven Berkoff, leading to his theatre company being influenced by the styles of physical theatre.<br />
        They practice &ldquo;total theatre&rdquo; &ndash; meaning any means possible is used to tell a story, including multimedia, choreographed movement and spoken word. However, their devised pieces tend to have little text, and are mostly composed of the former two. <br />
        They are an &ldquo;artist-led&rdquo; organization, meaning the cast are intricately involved in the devising of productions through a process of &ldquo;intense periods of experimentation, making brave leaps, failing and learning&rdquo;. <br />
        They aim to &ldquo;put [their] audience at the heart of [their] narrative&rdquo;, with productions &ldquo;open to interpretation&rdquo;.
        They also run workshops and are affiliated with the A-Level exam boards.
