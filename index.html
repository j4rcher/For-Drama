        Punchdrunk was formed in 2000 by artistic director Felix Barrett. They focus on &ldquo;blending classic text, physical performance, award-winning design installations and unexpected sites&rdquo;. <br />
        Their style of theatre is heavily immersive (related to Promenade Theatre); the audience is free to choose whether to focus on individual performances and themes, or &ldquo;treat [the performance] as an art installation.&rdquo;<br />
        They practice &ldquo;location theatre&rdquo; often performing in outside, open spaces. Unlike Gecko and Paper Birds, they mix both classic plays and devised work. <br />
        Recently, they&rsquo;ve begun wearing Greek masks during performances as they found that &ldquo;suddenly inhibition fell away and people found a sense of freedom in their anonymity&rdquo;.<br />
        Their ultimate aim is to reject &ldquo;passive obedience&rdquo; to the production that is usually expected of audiences. This is where they get their name; they want the audiences to feel &ldquo;Punchdrunk&rdquo; after performances.<br />
        They are a registered charity, and often run workshops in schools and colleges.<br />
        It is one of their YouTube videos that is playing on the homepage.<br />
